# Neural Machine Translation using Transformers on Portuguese to English 
## Overview
The project was centered around implementing transformer models for neural translation purposes. The dataset used was ted_hrlr_translate/pt_to_en, obtained from the TensorFlow website. 
The implementation was carried out using Keras and Python programming language, following the guidelines presented in the TensorFlow website tutorial on transformers. The project focused on exploring both single attention and multi-head attention mechanisms, and analyzing the weight of each head for certain examples by plotting a heatmap of the head weights. 
More details on the implementation and analysis can be found in the aforementioned tutorial.(<https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/transformer>)

This project was completed as part of the "Neural Networks" (changed to "Neural Computing and Deep Learning") course at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) in Tehran, Iran, taught by Professor Reza Safabakhsh(<safa@aut.ac.ir>). I took this course during my Master of Science degree in Computer Engineering at AUT in Spring 2022.
